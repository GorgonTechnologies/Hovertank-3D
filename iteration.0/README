*About the game*


In HOVERTANK 3-D you play mercenary Brick Sledge, hired by a beneficent
organization to rescue people from cities targeted for limited nuclear 
strikes.

Get in, get 'em, and get out, before the missile hits.

Climb on board your new HOVERTANK and go to it!


*Getting started*


For most players, starting this game is as simple as typing the following 
at the DOS prompt:

START followed by the [ENTER] key.


However, if you encounter a problem with your SVGA graphics display (if 
you have one), then type the following at the DOS prompt:

START /COMP followed by the [ENTER] key.


If you need further help, 
call our Technical Support group at 1-318-221-8311.


*Summary of how to play*

The cities are full of nuclear mutants, armored patrols, and other terrors
bent on your destruction.  You must enter the cities and rescue the 
innocent humans needing your help.

Here's the catch --- the nuclear missiles are on their way.  You must
rescue the people... the ones that are still alive.  You and the 
legendary HOVERTANK will not be teleported back to safety until you've
accomplished your mission.

You have an energy cannon as your main weapon.  Holding down the fire 
button will build up power in the cannon.  Release the button to fire.

After all the people in the area are either rescued or killed, a warp
gate will appear.  And, it may not appear where you teleported in...


Other things to know...


Watch the time.  If that missile arrives, goodbye HOVERTANK.

Be careful about picking up the people.  You don't want them killed by 
your stray cannon shots (and, of course, you get more money for more 
safely rescued people.)

Good luck!
